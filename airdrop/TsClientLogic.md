## typescript, the chosen one :)


### TL;DR
it all depends on timing, this was the best and most widely used client side language which offered what solana aligned with faster, cheaper and safest scaling

### throwback
ts was getting adopted in js world with greater speeds, which was aligned to solana's belief of
faster developer adoption on client side and better dev tooling.

eth also was shifting from its legacy js to typescript-native library, thus it was the best choice to ride the wave and offer the superior APIs in the best client side language ever known to humanity


### why ts is so based
It offers static typing, so it catches all the bad types at compile-time, you get correctly formatted code and better intellisense so now you can print your "hello, world!" on solana with ease

solana/web3.js was best of "class" at that time using interface and types gave exactly what you needed to send transactions, mint tokens and not mangling yourself in docs each time you imported

### ts is still the og with anza
web3.js had a bigger bundle, this was then fixed in solana/kit, no classes only functions, no external dependencies and what we used in the ts courseWork BigInt(),Crypto API are all introduced in new and improved solana/kit
